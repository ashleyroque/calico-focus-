Project for Axe Hacks Hackathon at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte 


We created a mobile interface that implements game-like elements in productivity tools such as to-do lists. The purpose of this app is to motivate users to complete their personal or academic tasks. For our example within the code, we implemented a reward system of 100 points which are called starberries per task completed on the current day. Our mascot cat will pop up when a task is accomplished to give feedback by congratulating the user for completing each task. 


The user can view current progress through a progress bar based on the tasks they completed. They can see a bar of how many points they have for their progress. The purpose of these starberries is redeem through a shop in which the user can redeem for furniture and decoration for their room. It increases or decreases based on their spending or saving decisions within the game.  Once a room is full, they can start over again with a new room. These rooms are built up to make parts of a house. 


Users can spend their starberries currency to decorate their room for their critter. If they donâ€™t complete their self-assigned tasks within a week, then they risk losing their room along with redeemed furniture and decoration from the shops tab.
