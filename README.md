Calico-Focus offers a gamified approach to task management, incentivizing productivity through rewards while maintaining accountability through potential consequences for inaction.

At the Axe Hacks Hackathon hosted at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, our team developed a mobile interface aimed at enhancing productivity by infusing game-like elements into traditional productivity tools like to-do lists.

Our app revolves around the concept of motivating users to accomplish their personal or academic tasks. In our implementation, we introduced a reward system wherein users earn 100 points, dubbed "starberries," for each task completed within the current day. To provide positive reinforcement, our mascot cat pops up to congratulate users upon completing tasks.

The app features a progress bar that visually represents users' current progress based on completed tasks, alongside a point tally reflecting their accumulated starberries. These starberries serve a dual purpose: users can redeem them in a virtual shop for furniture and decorations to customize their room. The user's decisions to spend or save starberries within the game impact their room's appearance, and once fully decorated, users can progress to a new room, gradually building up a virtual house.

However, there's a risk element integrated into the app's design: if users fail to complete their self-assigned tasks within a week, they face the consequence of losing their room, along with any furniture and decorations they've redeemed from the shop.
